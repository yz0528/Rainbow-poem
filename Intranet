#An intranet is a local area network established within a company or at home. 
It can share resources between multiple computers. Employees or family members can access each other after authorization. It can realize file management, application software sharing, and printing sharing. 
It is a closed network. The network environment is isolated from the external Internet, and the security of internal data is protected through firewalls or other devices. 
Just like a family, internal members share each other's lives and happiness.
