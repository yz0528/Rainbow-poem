An intranet is a private, internal network within an organization that allows employees to securely share information, collaborate on projects, and access tools and resources needed for work. 
Unlike the internet, which is open to the public, an intranet is restricted to authorized users, usually within a single organization. 
It operates through a similar structure to the internet but is only accessible through a companyâ€™s internal network or a secure login, ensuring data privacy and controlled access.
Document Sharing and Management: Centralizing important documents, forms, policies, and templates to ensure that employees have easy, consistent access to resources.
Communication and Collaboration: Providing platforms for news updates, team messaging, and collaborative workspaces, enhancing teamwork and communication.
Process Automation: Streamlining workflows by automating tasks, such as HR processes, request submissions, and project management.
